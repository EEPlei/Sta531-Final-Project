Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall


Cause I'm gliding up there oh so very high
That if the clouds were to drop me
Then I'd fall out the sky
I don't really know why I'm here
I guess I'm just here for the ride
I swear, it feels like I'm dreaming
It's vividly defined, yeah
So call me whatever you want
Title me to whatever you like
But let's get one thing straight
You know my name, so I run this town
When I'm on this mic, yeah
So here I go, B.O.B, Bobby Ray
I don't know, need I know
But I know, that I flow
Rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes
Then I go, as my story goes
I know I've done been down here before
Product of my east-decatur home
Cause I was in the cold
Trying to keep my toes unfroze
Now I'm in your house
Now I'm in your stoves
Now I'm everywhere that your iPod go
Everything I seen was a dream just a moment ago


Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall


Yeah, I'll fall much lower
Than where that pavement is
Cause there ain't no parachute
That they can make for this
Cause I put my pain
My heart, my soul, my faith in this
Does anyone feel like how I feel
Then you can relate to this
I just blazed with this
Maybe roll one up then take a hit
Toast to the good life then take a sip
Vacay everyday, yeah take a trip
It's easy to see I was made for this
From the womb all the way to the grave, I spit
Just to show y'all niggas what greatness is
Yeah, I'm talking very lucid, like making movies
To picture my life, Boy you need a higher resolution
I used to cut class in the day
Then runaway at night
But now I'm ruler of the upper class
And I don't even write


Well it was just a dream
Just a moment ago
I was up so high
Looking down at the sky
Don't let me fall
I was shooting for stars
On a Saturday night
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
They say what goes up
Must come down
But don't let me fall
Don't let me fall
